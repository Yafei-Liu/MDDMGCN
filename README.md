# MDDMGCN
## Overview  
The code for paper "A multi-task attention graph convolutional network method for miRNA-disease deep-level prediction". The repository is organized as follows:  
*   `miRNAdisease-task1` contains the datasets of Task 1 used in this paper.
*   `miRNAdisease-task2` contains the datasets of Task 2 used in this paper.
*   `miRNAdisease-task3` contains the datasets of Task 3 used in this paper.
*   `miRNAdisease-task4` contains the datasets of Task 4 uesd in this paper.
*   `MDDMGCN.py` is a computational model for four tasks.
